# Computational-Biophysics-in-Python

This repository contains code snippets for a course on Python programming for biophysics simulations. It is intended for people with intermediate to advanced proficiency in Python and some familiarity with computational physics. Unlike in the introductory course, here we will make liberal use of existing libraries, potentially including SciPy, networkx, biotite, PyMol, MEDYAN, NEURON, bmtk, nibabel, nilearn, PyTorch, and MEDRAS; and public data repositories such as Protein DataBank for crystallographic reconstructions of macromolecules, neuromorpho.org for multi-compartmental neuron morphology models, and openneuro.org for neuroimaging and electrophysiology datasets.

### Topics:
1. **Molecular Dynamics:** *Lennard-Jones Potential, Reaction-Diffusion Systems*
2. **Proteins:** *Crystallography Visualization, Ligand Binding Kinetics, Cytoskeletal Dynamics*
3. **Neurons:** *Hodgkin-Huxley Membrane Potentials, Multi-Compartmental Models*
4. **Neural Networks:** *Spiking Neural Networks, Percolation, fMRI Functional Connectivity, EEG Processing*
5. **Populations:** *Predator-Prey Dynamics, Food Webs, SIR Models, Network Contagion*
7. **Evolution:** *Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning*
8. **Radiation Biology:** *Cell Survival Models, Organelle Damage and Repair, OAR Dosimetry*
